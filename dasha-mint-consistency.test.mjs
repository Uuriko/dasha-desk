   referential: it asked whether the site agreed with its own config, never whether the config was
   right. Mutation-proved on 2026-08-11: replacing the mint across config/dasha.json, src/body.html
   and src/app.js with an unrelated address still printed PASS and exited 0. The shape check
   (/^[1-9A-HJ-NP-Za-km-z]{32,44}$/) accepted any base58 string, so it caught nothing either.
